3. **views.py**: Defines API view functions for handling image upload, retrieval, listing, and deletion.
4. **urls.py**: Specifies URL patterns for accessing API endpoints.
5. **permissions.py**: Includes custom permission classes for controlling access to API endpoints.
6. **tests.py**: Contains unit tests for testing API endpoints.
7. **migrations/**: Directory containing database migration files for image-related models.

## API Endpoints
